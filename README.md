# Graph 
This is a python script which draw a Finite State Machine designed using vhdl.
Fisrt of all, there is a example, where you must follow this style, especialy on the 
Next state decoding process. 
You need to use 'when' statements.
Attention on the spaces between 'if' and parenthesis '()', and between the assign symbol '<=' and the following string.
Also you must change the path in order to find the appropiate .vhd file

This FSM is not used for something, it's just a tutorial.

To execute this python script u must write in linux terminal

***python fsm_graph.py 4***	, '4' is the number of states u have described in your FSM.

You are free to make changes if you want.
